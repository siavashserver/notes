## Shaparak: Electronic Card Payment Network

### A. Shaparak Overview: Origin, Governance, and Scope

**Shaparak (شبکه الکترونیکی پرداخت کارت): The Electronic Card Payment Network**
is a state-sponsored enterprise and a subsidiary of the National Informatics
Corporation, itself owned by the Central Bank of Iran. Created in 2011, Shaparak
was established to unify, regulate, and supervise Iran’s burgeoning electronic
payments sector and to serve as the main clearinghouse/gateway for all POS and
online payments.

Shaparak’s principal mandates include:

- **Regulating Payment Service Providers (PSPs) and acquiring banks**
- **Managing and securing POS devices and online gateways**
- **Ensuring compliance with national standards and anti-fraud measures**
- **Handling transaction routing and clearing across network participants**

Shaparak is now one of the largest electronic payment processors in the region,
handling in excess of 50 billion transactions annually.

### B. Role within Iran’s Banking and Payment Ecosystem

#### 1. Core Functions

- **Transaction Switching:** Shaparak is the centralized switch through which
  all POS and online payment transactions are routed and authorized.
- **PSP Aggregation:** All licensed Payment Service Providers must connect their
  switches to Shaparak rather than directly interfacing with banks—a design that
  allows strict oversight and efficient dispute resolution.

#### 2. Payment Channel Supervision

- **POS Terminals:** Shaparak standardizes merchant onboarding, POS device
  certification, and terminal network management, overseeing millions of active
  POS devices nationwide.
- **Online Gateways and E-commerce:** All internet payment gateways (IPGs) route
  traffic through Shaparak, guaranteeing merchant compliance, transaction
  auditability, and security.

#### 3. Regulatory and Compliance Oversight

- **Anti-Money Laundering (AML):** Enforces monitoring and compliance tools,
  including real-time suspicious transaction reporting and support for sanctions
  enforcement.
- **Fraud Prevention:** Sets and audits technical, operational, and security
  standards for all PSPs, and enforces periodic re-certification.

#### 4. Cryptocurrency Oversight

Shaparak also regulates crypto exchanges based in Iran, a recent expansion of
its role, ensuring that such entities meet CBI directives and report key
transaction data.

### C. Shaparak Transaction Lifecycle

The typical payment flow for electronic payments:

1. **Cardholder initiates transaction** at merchant’s POS or online store.
2. **Merchant’s PSP routes request** to Shaparak.
3. **Shaparak verifies transaction** (format, limits, merchant status) and
   forwards it to the card-issuing bank for authorization.
4. **Response** (approve/decline) flows back through Shaparak to the merchant.
5. **Clearing and settlement:** At day’s end, batch settlement occurs via PAYA
   and final clearing at SATNA.

This structure centralizes operational risk, allowing faster detection and
reaction to cyberattacks—a quality that has both strengths and weaknesses, as
seen in the July 2025 major Shaparak outage which temporarily paralyzed POS
payments nationwide.

### D. Strategic Impact and Challenges

- **Market Efficiency:** The consolidation of payment flows and merchant
  acquisition reduced duplicate infrastructure, inflated fees, and unmonitored
  “shadow” acquirers.
- **Security & Trust:** Central security monitoring led to the rapid detection
  and mitigation of fraud, skimming, or data breaches.
- **Competition:** Shaparak’s licensing of PSPs transformed the acquiring market
  and stimulated the emergence of innovative fintech players under a level
  compliance playing field.
- **Resilience:** Centralization yields operational efficiency but also exposes
  systemic network points to failure or attack, a risk area highlighted in
  recent cyber events.
- **Internationalization:** Shaparak aligns closely with international
  standards, preparing Iran for future payment system interoperability with
  Russia’s MIR, BRICS Pay, and other networks.

### E. Comparison with Shetab

Shaparak should not be confused with Shetab:

- **Shetab** is an interbank clearing and card routing network covering all
  card-to-card, ATM, and EFTPOS interoperability.
- **Shaparak** manages merchant acquiring, POS/online routing, and PSPs. Shetab
  facilitates underlying card network switches while Shaparak manages the
  merchant- and customer-facing transaction flow and merchant network
  administration.
