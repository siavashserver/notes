## POL (پُل): The Instant Interbank Payment System

### Definition and Origin

POL—short for _Payment Order Link_ and widely referred to as the **‘سامانه
پرداخت لحظه‌ای’** (Instant Payment System)—was launched by the Central Bank of
Iran (CBI) in 2021 to fill a major gap in the Iranian payment landscape.
Designed as a real-time, interbank settlement platform, POL enables
instantaneous fund transfers between different banks, round-the-clock, using
IBAN (Shaba) identifiers. The emergence of POL has been pivotal for individuals
and small businesses, especially as e-commerce and digital financial activity
have increased the need for swift, secure micro-to-mid-sized transfers day and
night.

POL is not to be confused with broader payment platforms such as Shaparak or the
Point-of-Sale (POS) network. Instead, POL fills the niche between lower-value,
legacy systems like _card-to-card_ transfers and larger settlement platforms
like SATNA and PAYA, offering immediate settlement for single transfers with a
cap typically set at 15–50 million Tomans.

### Technical Function and Settlement Mechanism

From a technical standpoint, POL operates on a foundation akin to that of modern
instant payment networks worldwide. It is fully digital, leverages IBANs for
high security, and is accessible via all major internet and mobile banking
platforms. Once a payment order is issued via POL, funds are debited from the
sender’s account and credited to the recipient’s account in near real time
(often within seconds to three minutes), providing both parties with immediate
transaction confirmation.

The system is available 24/7/365, with no downtime for weekends or public
holidays—a significant advantage over rival methods which are restricted to
business hours or banking settlement cycles. This rapid settlement is
facilitated by direct communication between participating banks via the
centralized POL switching infrastructure, under the CBI’s regulatory oversight.

### Key Features

- **Transaction ceiling:** The standard cap for POL is 50 million Toman per
  transaction as of 2025, although some sources note prior implementation at 15
  million Toman and indicate the possibility of future increases pending
  regulatory updates.
- **Fee structure:** POL applies a commission rate of 0.02% of the transaction
  value, with a minimum fee of 500 Toman per transfer. This makes it both
  cost-effective and predictable, especially compared to traditional
  card-to-card methods.
- **Channels:** POL is available via bank branches (in-person), standard web
  banking portals, and mobile banking applications, although not all banks may
  have achieved complete integration.
- **Security:** By requiring IBANs instead of card numbers, POL transfers enjoy
  lower fraud risk and higher regulatory compliance.
- **Operational hours:** 24/7, every day of the year, regardless of weekends or
  public holidays.
- **Settlement speed:** Instantaneous—funds are typically credited to the
  recipient’s account within seconds up to a maximum of three minutes.

### Accessibility for Individuals and Businesses

POL’s digital-first design means it is highly accessible for individuals, small
businesses, and freelancers. Transfers can be made through multiple touchpoints:
internet banking, mobile apps, and in some banks, ATMs. For registered
businesses, POL offers low-cost and immediate payment capability—ideal for
settling supplier bills, contractor fees, or e-commerce receipts in scenarios
where transaction size does not exceed the POL cap.

### Limitations

Despite significant advantages, certain banks have yet to roll out full POL
integration, and for amounts above the system’s transaction ceiling (currently
set at 50 million Toman), users must revert to other platforms like PAYA or
SATNA. Additionally, banks or their software apps may apply further daily caps
or user-specific limits for regulatory compliance or risk management.

### Typical Use Cases

- Person-to-person payments exceeding the card-to-card cap but not high enough
  for PAYA or SATNA.
- E-commerce settlements between buyer and merchant or for instant wallet
  recharges.
- Peer-to-peer lending repayments.
- Freelance or gig worker payments.
- Bill settlements in real estate rental/lease agreements within the cap.

POL’s low transaction costs and instant availability make it a preferred option
for lower-value, high-frequency use cases where operational flexibility is
crucial.

## SATNA (ساتنا): Real-Time Gross Settlement for Large-Value Transfers

### Definition and Origin

SATNA, standing for **‘سامانه تسویه ناخالص آنی’** (Real-Time Gross Settlement,
RTGS), was initiated by the CBI in the mid-2000s to modernize and secure
large-value interbank transfers in Iran. Its core function is to enable the
near-immediate transfer of substantial sums (above preset minimum thresholds)
between accounts at different banks, fully replicating and, in many respects,
superseding the former practice of using certified, paper-based bank drafts or
“coded checks”.

SATNA’s architecture is in line with international RTGS principles, ensuring
that each transfer is settled individually on a gross (not batch) and
irrevocable basis, with funds moving immediately and unconditionally from sender
to recipient.

### Operational Mechanics

Fundamentally, SATNA connects the internal payment and accounting systems of
nearly all major Iranian banks via a secure messaging and settlement
backbone—overseen by the Central Bank. Upon initiation, the system immediately
debits the sender’s account and credits the recipient’s account at the
destination bank, with both parties notified. Settlement typically completes
within 20–30 minutes, with time variation depending on network conditions and
the responsiveness of the recipient bank.

### Key Features

- **Minimum and maximum transaction thresholds:** For most banks, the minimum
  transfer via SATNA is set at 50 million Toman (some sources mention 100
  million Toman for internet-based transfers due to risk controls) and the
  maximum at 200 million Toman for online/app-based transactions. There is no
  upper limit for in-person, branch-initiated transfers provided that
  originators supply appropriate documentation and justification (often
  mandatory for anti-money laundering compliance).
- **Fee structure:** 0.02% of the transferred amount, capped at 25,000 Toman per
  transaction—a significant saving compared to legacy certified checks but
  notably higher than PAYA fees.
- **Channels:** Accessible via bank branches for all eligible customers, and,
  for most banks, via internet and mobile banking apps (subject to
  identification and second-factor authentication requirements).
- **Security:** Transfers require the recipient’s IBAN. All transfers are final
  and cannot be reversed through the banking system’s standard protocols once
  executed, reducing the risk of recall or fraud.
- **Operational hours:** SATNA operates during Iranian banking business
  days—typically Saturday to Thursday, 8:00 am to 14:30 pm. No settlement occurs
  on Fridays or official public holidays, although transfer requests may be
  scheduled for the next available working day.
- **Settlement speed:** Usually completed within 20 to 30 minutes during
  operational hours. Transfers submitted after cut-off or during holidays are
  settled the next business day.

### Accessibility for Individuals and Businesses

SATNA is intended for sizable, often mission-critical transactions: home or auto
purchases, large business settlements, or corporate payments. For individuals,
it is the platform of choice when moving sums beyond card-to-card, POL, or PAYA
ceilings, for instance in real estate, vehicle purchases, or high-value legal
settlements.

For businesses and legal entities, SATNA is the backbone of large-value supplier
payments, cross-bank payroll for high earners, and large-scale financial
settlements, with additional regulatory checks for transfers substantially over
published thresholds (requiring documentation/proof of transaction purpose).

### Limitations and Challenges

The main drawbacks of SATNA include restricted operational hours—transactions
cannot be settled at night, on Fridays, or during public holidays. Furthermore,
the necessity of documentation for large transactions (especially
in-person/branch-based ones exceeding regulatory limits) can introduce
administrative friction. Its per-transaction cost, while lower than traditional
certificates or checks, remains higher than other digital transfer methods,
making it less ideal for routine transactions.

### Typical Use Cases

- High-value real estate settlements or large business purchases.
- Clearing corporate debts between companies, especially sums >100 million
  Toman.
- Distribution of funds in inheritance, court order, or government contract
  scenarios.
- Other legal or regulatory-mandated large payments where irrevocable, speedy
  finality is required.

## PAYA (پایا): Automated Clearing House for Mass, Scheduled, and Mid-Range Transfers

### Definition and Origin

PAYA—_سامانه پایاپای الکترونیکی_ (Automated Clearing House, ACH)—was rolled out
by the CBI as Iran’s premier batch settlement and automated bulk payment
platform, analogous to ACH systems elsewhere globally. Designed to handle
scheduled, periodic, and mass payments (both credits and debits), PAYA
revolutionized the efficiency of multi-party settlements for businesses, public
bodies, and individual users.

Importantly, PAYA enables both **scheduled one-to-one** and **one-to-many or
many-to-one** transfers, a capability missing from both POL and SATNA, making it
essential for organizations needing recurring or bulk disbursements (e.g.,
salaries, dividends, or utility payments).

### Technical Architecture

Technically, PAYA processes fund transfers by grouping (batching) them into
several daily settlement “cycles.” Payments are accepted throughout the day, but
are only executed at set clearing times (historically four main cycles per day),
resulting in a built-in lag between initiation and final credit to the recipient
account. By using IBANs, PAYA ensures security and cross-bank consistency, and
the system settles with netting—minimizing the net flow of funds between banks
in each cycle.

### Key Features

- **Transaction ceiling:** For online transfers, the cap is 100 million Toman
  per instruction per day. For branch-based in-person payments, it can be up to
  200 million Toman per day (regulatory policy varies between banks and is
  subject to annual review).
- **Minimum transfer:** No minimum; even minor sums can be sent via PAYA—a
  unique differentiator.
- **Batch processing times:** Four main daily cycles (03:45, 10:45, 13:45,
  18:45) on working days. Some sources report three cycles or variable schedules
  depending on institution and day of week, with fewer cycles on holidays and
  Fridays.
- **Fee structure:** 0.01% of the transfer amount, capped at 2,500 Toman per
  transaction—the lowest among interbank systems, especially advantageous for
  small, high-frequency, or bulk multi-party payments.
- **Channels:** All major banks offer access via online and mobile banking apps,
  as well as through in-person visits to branches.
- **Security:** All payments are via IBAN, with full processing records and
  reconciliation. Bulk debits and bulk credits possible with pre-authorization
  and supporting files.
- **Settlement timing:** Not real time—funds are settled in the next scheduled
  cycle. If a transfer is made after the cut-off for a given cycle or on a
  public holiday, it is held for the next available processing window.

### Accessibility for Individuals and Businesses

PAYA is accessible to virtually all users of the Iranian banking network:
individuals, businesses, fintech platforms, corporates, and government bodies.
For individuals, it is ideal for routine or moderate-value transfers that do not
require instant finality but benefit from lower fees. For enterprises, PAYA’s
main strength lies in its _bulk_ payment and _direct debit/credit_ features,
which facilitate payroll administration, dividend disbursements, group vendor
payments, and receivable collections on a scheduled basis.

### Limitations

The key drawbacks of PAYA are its non-instant nature—transfers settle only at
dedicated cycles—and the strict per-transaction ceiling. For last-minute,
urgent, or large-sum transfers, users must use POL or SATNA instead. Delays may
also be encountered for instructions submitted at the end of business days or
just before weekends/holidays.

### Typical Use Cases

- Monthly salary disbursement for companies with hundreds or thousands of
  employees.
- Utility company mass bill collection.
- Payment of dividends to investors en masse.
- Recurrent debits for subscriptions, insurance, or installment plans.
- Routine B2B or B2C settlements, provided the cap is not exceeded.
