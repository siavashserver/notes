title: Continuos Integration / Continuos Deployment (CI/CD)
---

## CI/CD Basics

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is the practice whereby developers integrate
code into a shared repository frequently—often several times a day. Each
integration triggers an automated build and suite of tests, enabling early
detection of integration issues and ensuring that the codebase remains in a
deployable state at all times.

**Continuous Deployment (CD)** extends CI by automating the delivery of
validated builds to production. With CD, code changes that pass automated
reviews and tests are automatically deployed to users without human
intervention, reducing the lead time for changes and increasing business
agility.

In practice, CI/CD results in:

- **Improved software quality** through automated regression, integration, and
  security tests on every code change.
- **Reduced manual intervention**, minimizing the risk of human error.
- **Shorter release cycles** and rapid iteration based on user feedback.
- **Automated rollback** mechanisms for swift remediation if issues arise in
  production.
- **Seamless, routine deployments** that transform software releases from
  high-risk events to predictable and low-risk push-button operations.

## Common CI/CD Patterns

Understanding and leveraging robust design patterns—and avoiding established
anti-patterns—are critical to effective pipeline architecture and high
performance engineering.

### Essential CI/CD Pipeline Patterns

- **Pipeline as Code:** Pipelines are defined in version-controlled files (e.g.,
  `Jenkinsfile`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `azure-pipelines.yml`). Benefits include
  auditable changes, peer review, reproducibility, and easier troubleshooting.
  This approach supports collaboration and aligns the pipeline configuration
  lifecycle with the application codebase.

- **Trunk-Based Development:** Encourages short-lived feature branches merged as
  quickly as possible into the main branch, reducing merge conflicts and the
  complexity of integration. This pattern supports rapid feedback and continuous
  delivery.

- **Microservices Pipelines:** Each service has its independent build and deploy
  pipeline. Enhances granular fault isolation, scales horizontally, and prevents
  cascading failures due to tightly coupled workflows.

- **Build Once, Deploy Many:** Artifacts (e.g., Docker images) are built once
  and promoted through environments (dev, QA, prod), ensuring consistency and
  eliminating environment drift.

- **Immutable Infrastructure:** Infrastructure is provisioned automatically via
  code, and each change results in new instances rather than modifying existing
  ones. Reduces configuration drift risks and ensures parity between
  environments.

- **Feature Flags:** Allow incomplete features to be deployed as disabled code,
  decoupling releases from deployments and supporting progressive delivery,
  canary tests, and rapid rollback.

#### Pipeline Patterns Table

| Pattern                 | Description                                  | Key Benefit                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Pipeline as Code        | Define pipelines in version-controlled files | Audit, collaboration, repeatable |
| Trunk-Based Development | Short-lived branches, mainline merges        | Fast feedback, less complexity   |
| Build Once, Deploy Many | Same artifact is used across environments    | Consistency, less drift          |
| Feature Flags           | Feature toggling at runtime in production    | Safe rollouts, progressive tests |

_Applying these patterns enforces both speed and reliability throughout the
CI/CD cycle and supports organizational agility and quality._

### CI/CD Anti-Patterns (and Their Solution Approaches)

While robust patterns enable predictability and scalability, recurring
anti-patterns frequently cause CI/CD initiatives to fail or stagnate.
Recognizing and addressing these is a crucial senior engineering responsibility.

#### Common CI/CD Anti-Patterns

- **Monolithic Pipelines:** Single, massive pipelines with tightly coupled
  steps; they lack separation of concerns, are difficult to maintain, and slow
  to execute and debug.
- **Manual Steps:** Any manual gate (approvals, tests, rollouts) introduces
  bottlenecks, inconsistency, and negates the value of automation.
- **Lack of Automated Testing:** Reliance on manual or ad-hoc testing, leading
  to infrequent deployments and low confidence in releases.
- **Poor Version Control & Lack of “Pipeline as Code”**: Managing pipeline logic
  outside of VCS makes changes untrackable and irreproducible.
- **Environment Drift & Non-Parity:** Different configurations between staging
  and production environments lead to “works on my machine” failures.
- **Hardcoded Secrets:** Embedding credentials or secrets in scripts or code is
  a major security risk; proper secret management is mandatory.
- **Overcomplication:** Pipelines with excessive stages, bespoke scripting, and
  insufficient modularization increase onboarding time and errors.

**Resolving Anti-Patterns:**

- Modularize pipelines, use templates and reusable components.
- Automate all testing; enforce coverage but avoid excessive testing that slows
  delivery.
- Adopt environment parity using containerization (e.g., Docker) and IaC.
- Leverage secret management tools (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
- Ensure observable, version-controlled pipelines that fail fast and provide
  actionable feedback.

  CI/CD, security, and registry, especially beneficial for regulated industries
  or as a DevOps platform.
- **GitHub Actions** is optimal for teams building entirely on GitHub, enabling
  rapid automation without setup overhead.
- **CircleCI** and other cloud-first tools shine in cloud-native, fast-paced
  projects due to their speed and ease of use.
- **Argo CD** and **Flux** are purpose-built for Kubernetes-native “pull-based”
  (GitOps) CD, syncing cluster state automatically from Git; ideal for
  Kubernetes-centric organizations.
- **Tekton** represents the Kubernetes-native evolution of pipeline systems,
  enabling modular and extensible workflows tailored for cloud-native teams.
- **Spinnaker** excels in advanced progressive deployment, such as automated
  canary analysis and multi-cloud rollout orchestration.

## Software Deployment Methods & Strategies

Effective deployment is the result of integrating robust delivery strategies,
architectural patterns, and best practices—especially vital when leveraging
container orchestration with Kubernetes. Modern deployment must minimize risk
(rollbacks), downtime, and user disruptions, achieving security and compliance
simultaneously.

### Key Deployment Strategies

| Strategy       | Mechanism                                       | Pros                                 | Cons/Considerations                   | Best Use Case                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Rolling Update | Gradual replacement of old Pods/instances       | No downtime, simple rollback         | Slow to catch major regressions       | Microservices, stateless apps   |
| Blue-Green     | Two identical environments; switch traffic      | Zero downtime, instant rollback      | Infra cost (duplicate), not for minor | Critical systems, major changes |
| Canary Release | Small subset gets new version; expand & monitor | Controlled risk, early bug detection | Complex routing, monitoring needed    | Risk-averse, large userbase     |
| Recreate       | Shut down old version, start new version        | Simple                               | Downtime for users                    | Early-stage, low-priority apps  |
| Feature Flags  | Toggle features without deploy                  | Rapid iteration, easy rollback       | Extra logic in codebase               | Experiments, gradual rollout    |

#### Example Strategy Table

| Strategy   | Downtime | Rollback Ease | Traffic Control | Ideal Use Case                       |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Rolling    | None     | Quick         | Gradual         | High-availability, always-on systems |
| Blue-Green | None     | Immediate     | Binary          | Zero downtime, rapid rollback        |
| Canary     | Minimal  | Easy          | Fine-grained    | Early user feedback on new features  |

### Deployment Examples (Kubernetes YAML)

**Rolling Update**

```yaml
strategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxSurge: 1
    maxUnavailable: 1
```

This ensures at least `N-1` Pods of your app are available during upgrade.

**Blue-Green Deployment**  
Deploy “green” alongside “blue”, update service selectors to point to “green”
once validated.

**Canary Deployment** Deploy new version as a small replica set, incrementally
shift traffic from the old to the new, monitor and abort/rollback if issues are
detected.

### Best Practices for Deployment Success

1. **Environment Parity & Configuration**

   - Use containerization (Docker) and IaC (Terraform/Helm/Kustomize) to ensure
     dev, staging, and prod environments are consistent.
   - All configurations and secrets should be versioned and managed securely.

2. **Automate Rollbacks**

   - Make rollback a single, automated command in both pipeline and deployment
     code.
   - Kubernetes: `kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-app`.

3. **Test Thoroughly Before and After Release**

   - Bake in multiple test types: unit, integration, e2e, regression,
     performance, smoke tests.
   - Monitor application and system health continuously post-deployment;
     instrument for key user and system metrics using Prometheus, Grafana, and
     ELK/EFK/Loki stacks.

4. **Security & Compliance**

   - Integrate container/image scanning (Snyk, Trivy), dependency scanning
     (SCA), and static/dynamic application security testing into your pipelines.
   - Manage secrets with dedicated tools and restrict permissions using RBAC
     policies.

5. **Observability & Monitoring**
   - Track build/deploy frequency, change failure rate, mean time to recovery
     (MTTR), and deployment lead time (DORA metrics).
   - Set clear, actionable alerts for system and deployment health.

## Kubernetes Integration: CI/CD Workflows, Patterns, and Tooling

Kubernetes is the definitive platform for orchestrating microservices and
managing complex deployments, but it brings a new set of patterns and best
practices for CI/CD integration.

### Kubernetes Concepts in CI/CD

- **Declarative Infrastructure**: Use YAML manifests/Helm charts to define the
  intended state of applications and services. Apply via GitOps for auditability
  and automation.
- **Workload Controllers**: Leverage Deployments for stateless apps,
  StatefulSets for stateful workloads, DaemonSets for cluster-wide agents, and
  Jobs for batch/one-shot tasks.

#### Example Kubernetes Deployment Manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myapp
          image: myregistry/myapp:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```

**Key Notes:**

- `.spec.selector` must match `.spec.template.metadata.labels`.
- `strategy: RollingUpdate` is default; using `maxSurge`, `maxUnavailable`
  manages update lifecycle and downtime.
- Use ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configuration and sensitive credentials
  securely.

### Kubernetes-Native CI/CD Tools

**Argo CD:**  
Declarative GitOps tool that syncs cluster state from Git repositories; supports
automated and manual sync, web UI, multi-cluster, and RBAC.

**Flux CD:**  
Lightweight, controller architecture GitOps tool supporting multi-git,
multi-cluster, and fine-grained RBAC. CLI-first and modular.

**Tekton:**  
Extensible, Kubernetes-native CI/CD pipeline engine, using custom resources to
define and run build/test/deploy pipelines as pods.

| Feature/Tool         | Argo CD             | Flux CD                    | Tekton                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| GitOps Sync          | Yes                 | Yes                        | With extra steps               |
| Helm Support         | Yes                 | Native                     | As pipeline tasks              |
| UI                   | Rich                | CLI/Friendly (via Devtron) | No (Tekton Dashboard optional) |
| Multi-Cluster        | Yes                 | Yes                        | Yes                            |
| Progressive Delivery | Yes (Argo Rollouts) | Yes (Flagger)              | Via extensions                 |

### Kubernetes Deployment Best Practices

1. **Environment Isolation:** Use namespaces or even separate clusters for dev,
   staging, prod; enforce strict RBAC and network policies.
2. **Helm/Kustomize:** Use Helm charts for templating and versioned releases;
   Kustomize for patch-based environment overlays.
3. **Secrets Management:** Store secrets in Kubernetes Secrets, encrypted at
   rest, and/or use external key management services; avoid hardcoding secrets.
4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Restrict permissions for users and
   CI/CD service accounts at the namespace and resource level; audit access
   routinely.
5. **Observability:** Deploy metrics collection, logging, and tracing sidecars
   across app pods and pipelines; set actionable alerts for all stages.
6. **Progressive Delivery:** Use Argo Rollouts or Flagger to safely execute
   blue-green, canary, and other complex deployment strategies natively in
   Kubernetes.
7. **Automated Rollbacks:** Exploit built-in rollback commands (`kubectl rollout
undo`, `helm rollback`) with metrics-driven or error-threshold triggers.
8. **Pipeline Security:** Pull request reviews of both app and manifest changes,
   image scanning, signature verification, and immutable tags.
9. **Testing Before/After Deploy:** Use “smoke” and functional tests
   post-deployment; automate testing in ephemeral environments that match
   production as closely as possible.

---

## Monitoring and Observability for CI/CD Pipelines

Effective CI/CD must be measurable, observable, and provide actionable
insight—especially in large, dynamic systems with Kubernetes at their core.

### Key Metrics

- **Build Time:** Speed of build phases; slow builds delay feedback cycles.
- **Test Success Rate/Coverage:** Percentage of passing/covered tests; key for
  defect prevention.
- **Deployment Frequency:** Rate at which production deploys occur; a DORA
  metric.
- **Change Failure Rate:** Percentage of deployments causing issues; another
  DORA metric.
- **Time to Deploy:** Measures pipeline bottlenecks and can drive optimizations.
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR):** Average time to restore service after a
  failed deployment.
- **Resource Utilization:** CPU, memory, and disk usage of build/test/deploy
  agents and clusters.
- **System Health:** Monitoring Kubernetes cluster metrics, agent availability,
  and environment status.

#### Example Monitoring Dashboard Layout

| Metric          | Frequency  | Purpose                   |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| Build Status    | Real-time  | Detect failed builds      |
| Build Time      | Hourly     | Performance optimization  |
| Test Pass Rate  | Daily      | Quality tracking          |
| Deployment Rate | Real-time  | Delivery throughput       |
| MTTR            | On failure | Incident response measure |

**Tools:**

- For metrics: Prometheus (scraping), Grafana (dashboards), Thanos
  (aggregation).
- For logs: ELK/EFK stack, Loki, Splunk.
- For tracing: Jaeger, Zipkin.
- For alerting: Prometheus Alertmanager, PagerDuty integrations.

## Security and Compliance in CI/CD

Security is integral, not additive, in modern CI/CD. DevSecOps integrates
security from code to cluster, implementing compliance gates, automated risk
analysis, secret management, and policy enforcement.

### Security Best Practices

- **Shift Left:** Static Analysis (SAST), Software Composition Analysis (SCA),
  and secret scanning during the earliest commit stages.
- **Dynamic Analysis (DAST) and Runtime Security:** Automated penetration and
  runtime security scanning before and in production.
- **Secret Management:** Never store secrets in source, images, logs, or
  manifests. Use Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Kerberos-backed solutions;
  inject via runtime identity and RBAC, not plaintext variables.
- **Least Privilege Runners:** Build and deploy agents/services have only the
  permissions required; ephemeral runners prevent persistent attack surfaces.
- **Container Image Signing:** Sign containers at build time; verify signatures
  on deploy with admission controllers (e.g., Cosign/Sigstore).
- **Automated Compliance:** Gate releases on compliance checks—policy as code,
  audit logs, and artifact signing.

**Industry Guidance:**  
Follow NSA and CISA’s published guidance for secure cloud CI/CD practices, which
emphasize strong authentication, access control, and securing both the
development process and delivery pipelines.

## Interview Questions

### What is the difference between Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment?

- **Continuous Integration** involves automatically building and testing code
  changes as they are integrated into a shared repository.
- **Continuous Delivery** automates the software release process so that any
  validated build can be released with a manual approval step.
- **Continuous Deployment** takes this further—validated builds are
  automatically released to production with no manual intervention. CD (in
  practice) often refers to both continuous delivery and deployment, though the
  degree of automation differs.

### Describe key anti-patterns in CI/CD and their solutions.

Anti-patterns include monolithic pipelines, manual steps, lack of automated
tests, inconsistent environment parity, and poor secret management.

**Solutions:** Modularize pipelines, automate all steps (tests, deploy,
rollback), enforce secrets management, and use containers/IaC for replicated
environments.

### What benefits does the "pipeline as code" approach bring?

It makes pipelines auditable, version-controlled, and reproducible. Changes are
peer-reviewed through pull requests, support collaboration, and allow for
compliance tracking. Pipeline definition moves at the same speed and quality as
code, enforcing automation best practices.

### What are feature flags and how do they facilitate progressive delivery?

Feature flags are toggles, typically implemented in code/config, allowing
granular activation of features post-deploy. They support progressive rollouts,
rapid rollback without redeploy, A/B testing, and minimize deployment risk.

### Compare blue-green and canary deployments.

| Aspect          | Blue-Green                               | Canary                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Principle       | Deploys to parallel env & traffic switch | Gradually release to small user segment |
| Rollback        | Immediate traffic switch                 | Stop further rollout, revert traffic    |
| Risk/Monitoring | Binary switch, instant validation        | Progressive monitoring, fine-grained    |
| Resource Usage  | Needs two full environments              | Only scaled up proportionally           |
| Use Case        | Major releases needing instant cross-cut | Feature/patch with real-world exposure  |

_In both, clear monitoring and rollback procedures are critical. Canary is
better for catching unknown regressions at small scale; blue-green excels for
rapid all-or-nothing changes with clear pre/post-testing_.

### How do you securely deploy applications using CI/CD in Kubernetes?

- Use Kubernetes Secrets for configuration, encrypted at rest.
- Tie CI/CD user or service account permissions tightly via RBAC.
- Use image scanning in the CI stage and block unsigned images at admission.
- Automate config via Helm/Kustomize, promote immutability.
- All changes flow through GitOps, ensuring auditable state.

### What are the differences between Deployment, DaemonSet, and StatefulSet in Kubernetes?

| Object      | Use Case                          | Persistence | Identity          |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Deployment  | Stateless/fault-tolerant services | No          | Interchangeable   |
| DaemonSet   | One pod per node (e.g. infra)     | No          | Interchangeable   |
| StatefulSet | Stateful (e.g., DB clusters)      | Yes         | Persistent naming |

_StatefulSets preserve order and storage, vital for databases, while Deployments
are for rapid, stateless scaling; DaemonSets for cluster-wide agents like
logging_.

### What strategy minimizes downtime during rolling updates in Kubernetes?

The default `RollingUpdate` strategy, with tuned `maxUnavailable` and `maxSurge`
parameters, allows for stable, overlapping roll-in and roll-out of pods,
ensuring constant user availability. Readiness/liveness probes and
PodDisruptionBudgets further reinforce availability.

### What metrics would you monitor in a CI/CD pipeline and why?

- **Build/Deploy Frequency:** Health of delivery cycle.
- **Build/Deploy Time:** Performance, bottleneck ID.
- **Change Failure Rate:** Quality gate.
- **MTTR:** Recovery speed for incidents.
- **Resource Utilization:** Infra health.
- **Test Pass Rate/Coverage:** Codebase quality.

_Dashboards leveraging Prometheus, Grafana, and alert integrations provide
actionable, real-time feedback_.

### How do you integrate security into CI/CD pipelines ("shift left")?

- SAST and SCA at early commit/merge stages.
- DAST in pre-production.
- Secret scanning in code and images.
- Enforce policy as code at deployment gates.
- Runtime security (RBAC, PodSecurityAdmission, audit logs) in the target
  Kubernetes environment.
